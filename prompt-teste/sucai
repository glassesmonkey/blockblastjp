#How to Play Block Blast Online
Click on a group of 2 or more blocks of the same color to destroy them in Block Blast. If you let them reach the top, it's game over.

If you are a fan of other block placement games like Drop and Pullfrog, then Block Blast will be right up your alley. Not only is it fast-paced, but the gameplay is smooth and intuitive.

There are four different modes, and each mode has three different levels. You can get a new high score in every one! We recommend that you start with the easy mode in each setting just to get a feel for how the game works. While they may all look pretty similar, there are still some unique growing pains in every single Block Blast online mode. Let’s hop into what the four different modes are.

Default
A row of blocks descends from the top of the square all the way to the bottom. This is the most basic one that is great for players who are brand new to the game.

Sideways
A row of blocks from the left will move to the right. It is basically just the default mode, but rotated 90 degrees. Once you get the default version down, this is a great way to expand your horizons a bit.

Dual
One row from the top of the square will fall, then a row from the bottom will lift up. The dual mode is really when Block Blast online starts to get a little bit complicated. Players will need to pay attention to several variables at once.

Spinwheel
The grid is divided into four squares and a row will fall in each square one at a time. This mode is made for the Block Blast experts! Players must be skilled at understanding how all of the blocks interact with one another. You should definitely start out with the easiest setting first when playing the Spinwheel mode. Only once you feel comfortable with the mechanics should you move on to the medium or hard difficulty.

Block Blast Tips
There are a few basic tips to become a better Block Blast player. Read on to learn 3 basic strategies that should help you get further into the game.

Take your time
A lot of the time new players will get frazzled and start clicking haphazardly off the start of the game. However, this will usually end poorly, as there is little planning involved. Instead, take your time and really think about how to use your blocks efficiently.

Start off easy
While it may be tempting to start off with one of the harder game modes, such as Spinwheel or Dual, we recommend going back to the basics with the Default mode. This will give you an opportunity to learn the basics and really gain a solid understanding of Block Blast online.

Stay focused
When you are playing Block Blast, it is important that you keep your focus and avoid distractions. Avoid playing in noisy rooms or really any environment that will throw you off. The ability to hone in on the task at hand is one of the most important parts of Block Blast.

How many levels are there in block blast?
There is no limit to how long you can play Block Blast. The game will continue until the board completely fills up. At that point, you can look at your final score and see if it's a new record. The entire objective of Block Blast is not to "beat" the game, it's to get the highest score that you can.  

What is a good way to get more points?
One of the best ways to improve upon your score is to wait for blocks to create large clusters before you get rid of them. If you get rid of 2 yellow blocks at a time, they will yield very few points. However, if you wait for there to be a formation of 10 or 15 yellow blocks, you can get up to thousands of points! It is all about using your resources efficiently.
